finite number of ethernet addresses ~281 trillion
IP addr - 32 bits
receiveing exactly the same sequence it was sent - can this rule be violated by IP-protocol?
list of DNS servers, how to find
quantity of cycles read-write on flash memory
is it mandatory to create server-client communication

"On the server side, the application creates the socket with socket(), and then
calls bind() to specify which local address and port to use"

if I have wlan0 and eth0 simultaniusly, what's so?
bind of client's socket when UDP, but not when TCP

is any IP with 127 in the head local? 

what is socket? i mean it can queue incoming connections, 
why should i create new socket for send; full-duplex, isn't it?

why is there field addr in accept() function
